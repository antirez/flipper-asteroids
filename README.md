This is an implementation of the classic Asteroids game for the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/). Inside you will find a simple 2D engine that can be reused to implement other games.

Controls:
* Left/Right: rotate ship in the two directions.
* Ok, short press: fire bullets.
* Ok, long press: accelerate towards ship head.
* Down: decelerates.

This is a screenshot, but the game looks a lot better in the device itself:

P.S. Don't miss the game over screen.

## Installing the binary file (no build needed)

Drop the `asteroids.fap` file you can find in the `binaries` folder into the
following Flipper Zero location:

    /ext/apps/Games

The `ext` part means that we are in the SD card. So if you don't want
to use the Android (or other) application to upload the file,
you can just take out the SD card, insert it in your computer,
copy the fine into `apps/Games`, and that's it.

* If you see the error "API version mismatch" when trying to launch the game, try installing the app from source below.

## Installing the app from source

* Download the Flipper Zero dev kit and build it:
```
mkdir -p ~/flipperZero/official/
cd ~/flipperZero/official/
git clone --recursive  https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git  ./
./fbt
```
* Copy this application folder into `official/applications_user`.
* Connect your Flipper via USB.
* Build and install with: `./fbt launch_app APPSRC=flipper-asteroids`.
